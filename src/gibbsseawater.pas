(*
Calculates conductivity, C, from (SP,t,p) using PSS-78 in the range
2 < SP < 42.  If the input Practical Salinity is less than 2 then a
modified form of the Hill et al. (1986) fomula is used for Practical
Salinity.  The modification of the Hill et al. (1986) expression is to
ensure that it is exactly consistent with PSS-78 at SP = 2.

The conductivity ratio returned by this function is consistent with the
input value of Practical Salinity, SP, to 2x10^-14 psu over the full
range of input parameters (from pure fresh water up to SP = 42 psu).
This error of 2x10^-14 psu is machine precision at typical seawater
salinities.  This accuracy is achieved by having four different
polynomials for the starting value of Rtx (the square root of Rt) in
four different ranges of SP, and by using one and a half iterations of
a computationally efficient modified Newton-Raphson technique (McDougall
and Wotherspoon, 2012) to find the root of the equation.

Note that strictly speaking PSS-78 (Unesco, 1983) defines Practical
Salinity in terms of the conductivity ratio, R, without actually
specifying the value of C(35,15,0) (which we currently take to be
42.9140 mS/cm).

output both valid solutions.  To see this second solution the user
must call the programme with two outputs (i.e. [CT,CT_multiple]), if
there is only one possible solution and the programme has been

Calculates the mass fraction of ice (mass of ice divided by mass of ice
plus seawater), w_Ih_final, which results from given values of the bulk
Absolute Salinity, SA_bulk, bulk enthalpy, h_bulk, occuring at pressure
p.  The final values of Absolute Salinity, SA_final, and Conservative
Temperature, CT_final, of the interstitial seawater phase are also
returned.  This code assumes that there is no dissolved air in the
seawater (that is, saturation_fraction is assumed to be zero

When the mass fraction w_Ih_final is calculated as being a positive
value, the seawater-ice mixture is at thermodynamic equlibrium.

This code returns w_Ih_final = 0 when the input bulk enthalpy, h_bulk,
is sufficiently large (i.e. sufficiently "warm") so that there is no ice
present in the final state.  In this case the final state consists of
only seawater rather than being an equlibrium mixture of seawater and

Calculates dynamic height anomaly as the integral of specific volume

Hence, geo_strf_dyn_height is the dynamic height anomaly with respect
to a given reference pressure.  This is the geostrophic streamfunction
for the difference between the horizontal velocity at the pressure
concerned, p, and the horizontal velocity at p_ref.  Dynamic height

specific volume anomaly using the computationally efficient
expression for specific volume of Roquet et al. (2015).

This function evaluates the pressure integral of specific volume using
SA and CT interpolated with respect to pressure using the method of
Reiniger and Ross (1968).  It uses a weighted mean of (i) values
obtained from linear interpolation of the two nearest data points, and
(ii) a linear extrapolation of the pairs of data above and below.  This

Calculates the final Absolute Salinity, final Conservative Temperature

ice melts and is mixed into seawater whose properties are (SA,CT,p).
This code takes the seawater to contain no dissolved air.

value, the seawater-ice mixture is at thermodynamic equlibrium.

This code returns w_Ih_final = 0 when the input bulk enthalpy, h_bulk,
is sufficiently large (i.e. sufficiently "warm") so that there is no ice
present in the final state.  In this case the final state consists of
only seawater rather than being an equlibrium mixture of seawater and

If the ice contains no salt (e.g. if it is of glacial origin), then the
input 'SA_seaice' should be set to zero.

Ice formed at the sea surface (sea ice) typically contains between 2 g/kg

The Absolute Salinity, SA_brine, of the brine trapped in little pockets

(*
Calculates the ratio of SA to CT changes when sea ice melts into seawater.
It is assumed that a small mass of sea ice melts into an infinite mass of
seawater.  Because of the infinite mass of seawater, the sea ice will
always melt.

Ice formed at the sea surface (sea ice) typically contains between 2 g/kg
and 12 g/kg of salt (defined as the mass of salt divided by the mass of
ice Ih plus brine) and this programme returns NaN's if the input
SA_seaice is greater than 15 g/kg.  If the SA_seaice input is not zero,
usually this would imply that the pressure p should be zero, as sea ice
only occurs near the sea surface.  The code does not impose that p = 0 if
SA_seaice is non-zero.  Rather, this is left to the user.

The Absolute Salinity, SA_brine, of the brine trapped in little pockets
in the sea ice, is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the ice Ih that
surrounds these pockets.  As the seaice temperature, t_seaice, may be
less than the freezing temperature, SA_brine is usually greater than the
Absolute Salinity of the seawater at the time and place when and where
the sea ice was formed.  So usually SA_brine will be larger than SA.

The output, melting_seaice_SA_CT_ratio, is dSA/dCT rather than dCT/dSA.
This is done so that when (SA - seaice_SA) = 0, the output, dSA/dCT is
zero whereas dCT/dSA would be infinite.

Calculates the Turner angle and the Rsubrho as a function of pressure
down a vertical water column.  These quantities express the relative
contributions of the vertical gradients of Conservative Temperature
and Absolute Salinity to the vertical stability (the square of the
Brunt-Vaisala Frequency squared, N^2).  Tu and Rsubrho are evaluated at
the mid pressure between the individual data points in the vertical.

Note that in the double-diffusive literature, papers concerned with
the "diffusive" form of double-diffusive convection often define the
stability ratio as the reciprocal of what is defined here as the
stability ratio.
